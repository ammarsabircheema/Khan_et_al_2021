**Abstract:** Wastewater generated from industries contains numerous contaminants, among which heavy metals (HMs) are non-degradable. This research work highlights the use of commonly used ornamental plants, Nicotiana alata L. and Petunia hydrida L., with compost (C) and peat moss (M), and rhizospheric bacterial augmentation using Pseudomonas japonica, for the phytostabilization of HMs from synthetic wastewater. After plantâ€“soil acclimatization, plants were exposed for 6 weeks to synthetic wastewater, containing cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, nickel, and zinc concentrations (based on the HMs level of wastewaters collected from textile and pharmaceutical industry). Physiological response, biochemical status, and enzymatic fluctuations of plants and the distribution of HMs in plant parts and soil, were quantified. With the combined use (5% each v/v conditioner/soil) of C and M, in bio-augmented soil, physiological response and enzymatic status of both plants improved, with decreased stress injury due to HMs. Further, the plant HMs uptake was reduced, with better stabilization of HM in soil. For better phytostabilization of HMs in wastewater, the use of compost, peat moss, and bacterial augmentation is recommended with Nicotiana alata L. and Petunia hydrida L.
